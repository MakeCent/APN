Note that after training, when gose to test. Remember to check function proposals2json in the activitynet_dataset.py. Because it involves a video_name = video_name[2:] which is specially work for activitynet but not for other e.g dfmad. For dfmad, please temproally manully modify it.

The resulted results.json contain the proposals and their scores, but the proposals is in TIME unit. Which show the staring and ending second. Need manually decode
