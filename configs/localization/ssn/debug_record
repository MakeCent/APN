  File "mtrand.pyx", line 909, in numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState.choice
ValueError: a must be greater than 0 unless no samples are taken

Reason:
This is because training SSN requires finding foreground, background and incomplete proposals from all proposals.
While if the thresholds are not set well, it may cause one/all of them are empty.
The above error shows that there is no background proposals.

Fix:
The real problem I found is that the fps in ...proposal.txt files are 30.0. Revising all fps to 1.0 fixes this problem.
Because the num of frames in each video is computed with "num_of_frames * fps" in SSN (and the original PGCN).
While the num_of_frames in our proposal.txt is already the true total number of frames of videos.

If not help, then try to revise the arguments in snn_r50_450e_something_rgb_train.py:
"background_iou_threshold=0.01", "background_coverage_threshold=0.02", "incomplete_overlap_threshold=0.01"
to make sure the print information show that proposal pools all are not empty.

Error:
Found the mAP are all nan and some warning says that the num_gts in "recall_cumsum = tp_cumsum / num_gts" is 0.

Reason:
The class index label in proposal files starts with 0 to C-1. While SSN suppose the label index in proposal file
start with 1 to C.

Fix:
Revising the proposal file to +1 on all label index solved this problem. Retraining is required.
